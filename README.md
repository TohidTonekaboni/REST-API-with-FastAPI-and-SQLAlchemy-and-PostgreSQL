# REST-API-with-FastAPI-and-SQLAlchemy-and-PostgreSQL

FastAPI is a Python framework and set of tools that allow developers to invoke commonly used functions using a REST interface.

SQLAlchemy is a package that makes it easier for Python programs to communicate with databases. Most of the time, this library is used as an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) tool, which automatically converts function calls to SQL queries and translates Python classes to tables on relational databases.

Many web, mobile, geospatial, and analytics applications use PostgreSQL as their primary data storage or data warehouse.


In this repository you can find a simple example for setting up postgres db , create db , define ORM and code CRUD Operation.
